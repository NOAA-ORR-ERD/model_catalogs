``model_catalogs``
==================

Installation
------------

To install from PyPI:
  >>> pip install model_catalogs

Subsequently install a few packages by saving the `pip-requirements.txt` file locally and:
  >>> pip install -r pip-requirements.txt

These need to be installed separately because some of the packages on GitHub have updates that have not been included in any releases that are available otherwise.
