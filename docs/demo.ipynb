    "## Main Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to set up the main catalog. The main catalog provides access to all of the models and the various timings that are available for each model. The catalog is set up by reading in the `transform.yaml` catalog file, pointing it to the hard-wired original (\"orig\") catalog file for each model, and reading and copying in previously-calculated boundary information for the model (also saved in the repository). Every model catalog in the main catalog has at least a single timing for \"forecast\", but may have others (\"nowcast\", \"hindcast\", \"hindcast-forecast-aggregation\"). Each of those forecast timing sources in the model catalog has a `urlpath` that points to source for the model output so that a user can look at some model output. If the model output is available at a static link, that link is provided by `urlpath`. If the model output is available as a series of files that need to be aggregated (often for NOAA OFS models), then two example files are provided. The other timings besides \"forecast\" have either: `urlpath` point to the static access link if available, for nowcast models that have to be aggregated will point to two example files, and the rest (models that need to be aggregated and are timing \"hindcast\") have `urlpath` of null. Later in the process, the `urlpath` for all aggregated models will be filled in with the full listing of file locations that are requested by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main catalog is compiled from parts that are saved to the repository, but some of the model catalog files have Intake user parameters for today and/or yesterday that are filled in when the main catalog is run. To save time, the individual compiled catalog files are saved into a user application cache and are considered \"fresh\" for 6 hours (set in `mc.FRESH['compiled']` in the `__init__` file) since they need to be recreated for each day. When `mc.setup()` is run, the catalog will be put together fresh if either more than 6 hours have passed since last time it was run or `override=True` is input to force it to be recreated. Otherwise, the previously-written catalog files will be reread in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model catalog nested in the main catalog points to an original model catalog as a \"target\" for an Intake transform in `model_catalogs`. This transform is run when model output is requested from the model with `source.to_dask()` and it applies metadata stored in the model catalogs. The original model information can also be revealed with `source.target`.\n",
